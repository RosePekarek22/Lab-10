# Lab-10

I made this assignment using the p5js library - (p5.Polar.)[https://github.com/liz-peng/p5.Polar] In the makers own words, "_p5.Polar is a JavaScript library that extend p5.js standard drawing functions with versions using polar coordinates._" The library also utilizes its own arrays to change the size color of shapes exponentially. I think this library will be interesting to use further should I utilize it in my final project.
